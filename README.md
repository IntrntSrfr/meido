## Introduction

Meido (メイド), is a multipurpose Discord bot written in Golang, using [DiscordGo](https://github.com/bwmarrin/discordgo/).
Meido's main focus is to be a useful, helpful and fun bot for servers of all sizes. Meido provides simple yet effective
ways to help control a server. It has several commands used for moderation, such as a word filter, warning system,
autoroles and userroles. Simplicity and a good user experience is what I would like for Meido to aim for, and so I
hope she can be of service!

## Features

Meido contains several features that can be useful for running a server, as well as fun commands.

Features include:

* Moderation
  * Ban / Unban
  * Filter and warns
  * Lockdowns
  * Timeouts
* Custom roles
* Search functions such as YouTube or weather
* Utilities
  * Avatars and banners
  * User info
  * Server info
  * Colors
* Automatic media conversion
* Fishing for the boomer inside you (currently on a break)

The feature list will increase as time goes.
Some ideas for more features include:

* Raid protection (will be added)
* More media conversion such as webm to mp4
* Gambling
* XP and level system (maybe, as there are already tons of other bots with this feature)
* Autoroles

Ideas for other features are more than welcome!
